# ShellInterfaceFileLocatorC <br />
-findstuff.c is a file written in C that displays a shell and allows for commands to find files. <br />
-These commands include: <br />
  -find <filename> -f:ABC -s => find the given filename, both f and s are optional arguments. <br />
  -find <”text”> -f:ABC -s => find the given string in a file, both f and s are optional arguments.<br />
    -f:txt => using the -f:ABC flag tells the program to only looks at or in files with the ABC extension.<br />
    -s => using the -s flag tells the program to look in all sub-directories of the current directory for the string or filename.<br />
  -list => lists all running child processes and what they try to do. Also displays their serial number.<br />
  -kill <num>  => kills a child process, and so ends its finding attemps. In order to get the num argument, use list.<br />
  -quit or q => quits the program and all child processes immediately.<br />

-Included in this repository are a few .txt files I used for testing as well as a sub-directory I used for testing.<br />
